MovieFlix - iOS App with The Composable Architecture

MovieFlix is a modern iOS application built with SwiftUI and The Composable Architecture (TCA) that allows users to browse, search, and explore movies with a beautiful, intuitive interface.

Architecture Overview

MovieFlix is built using The Composable Architecture (TCA), a powerful state management framework that provides:

Unidirectional data flow for predictable state changes
Testable features with isolated reducers and effects
Dependency injection for easy testing and modularity
Type-safe state management with compile-time guarantees
Key Features

ðŸŽ¬ Movie Browsing

Discover popular movies with paginated lists
Search functionality with real-time results
Detailed movie information with rich metadata
ðŸŽ¨ Image Editing

Built-in image editor for movie posters
Multiple filter options and adjustments
Real-time preview and saving capabilities
ðŸ“± Modern UI

SwiftUI-based interface with smooth animations
Custom navigation and transition effects
Adaptive layout for all device sizes
Technical Architecture

Core Components

Network Layer

Generic HTTPClient with type-safe requests
URLSession-based implementation for production
Mock implementations for testing and previews
Comprehensive error handling with NetworkError enum

Dependency Management
@Dependency(\.movieService) var movieService
@Dependency(\.imageService) var imageService

Feature Structure

Each feature follows the TCA pattern:

@Reducer
struct MovieListFeature {
    @ObservableState
    struct State: Equatable { /* ... */ }
    
    enum Action: Equatable { /* ... */ }
    
    var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
        Reduce { state, action in
            // State management logic
        }
    }
}
